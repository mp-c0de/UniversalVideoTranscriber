# Universal Video Transcriber

**Universal Video Transcriber** is a native macOS application built with SwiftUI that provides powerful video transcription capabilities. It supports multiple transcription engines, including on-device Apple Speech, cloud-based AssemblyAI, and local, private transcription using OpenAI's Whisper models.

## Key Features

*   **Multi-Engine Support:**
    *   **Apple Speech:** Fast, free, on-device transcription (supports 60+ languages).
    *   **AssemblyAI:** High-accuracy cloud transcription with support for Lithuanian and speaker diarization.
    *   **Whisper (Local):** Private, high-accuracy transcription running locally on your Mac using `whisper.cpp`.
*   **Video Playback:** Integrated video player that synchronizes with the transcript.
*   **Transcript Editor:** robust editor to merge, split, delete, and correct transcript segments.
*   **Search:** Full-text search within generated transcripts.
*   **Export:** Export transcripts as plain text (`.txt`) or SubRip Subtitles (`.srt`).
*   **Lithuanian Support:** specialized support for Lithuanian language transcription via AssemblyAI and Whisper.

## Technical Architecture

*   **Platform:** macOS 13.0+ (Ventura or later)
*   **Language:** Swift 5.9+
*   **Framework:** SwiftUI
*   **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

### Core Components

*   **`TranscriptionManager`:** The central coordinator implementing the Strategy pattern to route requests to the selected provider.
*   **`WhisperService`:** Manages local `whisper-cli` execution, model management, and audio conversion.
*   **`AssemblyAIService`:** Handles communication with the AssemblyAI REST API.
*   **`PersistenceManager`:** (Legacy) managed local autosaves, now primarily handled via direct export.

## Prerequisites

*   macOS 13.0 or later
*   Xcode 14.0 or later (for building)
*   An AssemblyAI API Key (optional, for cloud transcription)

## Build & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mp-c0de/UniversalVideoTranscriber.git
cd UniversalVideoTranscriber
```

### 2. Whisper Integration (Critical)
This app relies on the `whisper.cpp` command-line tool for local transcription. You must compile it and add it to the project.

1.  **Clone and Build `whisper.cpp`:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp.git
    cd whisper.cpp
    make
    ```
2.  **Add to Xcode:**
    *   Locate the compiled `whisper-cli` binary (usually in the root or `build/bin` folder of the whisper.cpp repo).
    *   Drag and drop `whisper-cli` into the `UniversalVideoTranscriber/Resources` group in Xcode.
    *   **Important:** Ensure "Copy items if needed" is checked and "Add to targets" includes `UniversalVideoTranscriber`.

3.  **Add Libraries:**
    *   Locate `libggml.dylib` (and related `.dylib` files if applicable) generated by the build.
    *   Add them to the project in the same way.

### 3. Build and Run
*   Open `UniversalVideoTranscriber.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
*   Select the `UniversalVideoTranscriber` scheme.
*   Press `Cmd+R` to build and run.

## Usage Guide

1.  **Select Video:** Click "Select Video" to choose a file from your computer.
2.  **Choose Engine:** Use the toolbar to select Apple, AssemblyAI, or Whisper.
3.  **Configure:** Select the language (and Model for Whisper).
4.  **Transcribe:** Click the "Transcribe" button.
5.  **Edit:** Click the "Edit" button above the transcript to correct text or adjust timestamps.
6.  **Export:** Use the "Export" menu to save as Text or SRT.
